        <div class="content">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div class="text">
                Wanigaism is not a religion. A religion is a system of beliefs that have a central worshipped figure or a supernatural power. Wanigaism as a concept is not a collection of beliefs that centralise a supernatural being, but rather a set of rules that any creature created by any god or power that worships or believes in any theory or ideal can follow to live their life to the best. Wanigaism was invented by a wise man that truly lived his life to the fullest, Waniga. Even before reaching adulthood, Waniga already had a loving girlfriend, a good car, a dream physique, a job that paid well and most importantly, a never ending smile. <br> <br>
                However, Wanigas life was not perfect, Waniga was a victim to extortion. Being a man that gave off an aura of having a "perfect life" meant he was financially abused on multiple occasions by those around him and even speed cameras.
                But instead of letting this take effect on him, Waniga faced his problems with a smile on his face. This is what seperates him from the countless humans that normalize negative emotions that weigh them down and let the wellbeing of their lives be effected. This is what seperates him from those who follow Wanigaism, the "Wanigaists", and him who inspired its very establishment.
                This is the start of the First Lesson of Wanigaism, "Events do not define your life, it is your reaction to them that shapes the course of your life." But before the First Lesson, one clear statment must be made. Waniga is not god. Waniga is not a supernatural being. Waniga is the man who's ideals were weaved into Wanigaism. He is not the the figurehead of Wanigaism, but he is a man that must be respected beyond respect. So, who is Waniga?<br><br> Think of life as a river, think of us, you, everyone you've ever known and ever will know. We are all in our own rivers. Our rivers have bends, turns, rapids and for some people, waterfalls. Whatever you do, you have to swim through all of these obstacles, if you try to swim back the way you came, the current is going to sweep you right back. Some of us are swimming gracefully. Some of us are waddling along. Some of us have built boats that can speed right through. Until you get to the shallow ends. And some of us are drowning. But where is Waniga? Waniga is the one who walks on water.
